// What the opened file held that the model does not, pinned to the exact
// bytes it was read from. Two halves, mirroring Letters' LET-001
// `ImportProvenance`:
//
// * the safe subset a save carries back (`Carried`: custom XML, thumbnail,
//   ODF settings — the families `suite_common_core::carry` proves safe);
// * the scan of what no save can keep (`loss::content_a_save_drops`);
// * plus the advertised-opaque inventory: the uninterpreted part names
//   `OpaquePackage` captured at open, so a save can be held to
//   byte-identical preservation of exactly that set.
//
// All three used to be re-read from the live source path at save/dialog
// time (`window.rs::save_deck` recaptured, `loss_ui` rescanned), so a file
// deleted or replaced while open either warned about the wrong bytes or
// carried bytes the user never opened. The controller owns this context;
// the model owns content. After a successful save it is re-pinned to the
// bytes just written, which are the model's own — a file Decks wrote has
// nothing left to warn about.
//
// Graph ownership (first-PR safe subset): the carried families survive any
// modeled edit, because nothing the writers regenerate refers to them and
// they refer to nothing the writers regenerate (the `carry` safety table).
// Everything else the model does not hold is never copied half-consistent:
// the stored loss report names it before a destructive save. Edits record
// their dependencies in `MutationSet` so later relationship families can
// invalidate precisely; an unknown dependency blocks preservation or asks
// for a lossy copy, never guesses. `MutationSet` only grows within a
// session — undo included — so history can never forget that unsupported
// content became unsafe.
//
// Deliberately not synced by `collab.rs`: provenance pins one session's
// opened bytes. Sharing it across peers would resurrect one machine's
// stale parts into another's save. Each session captures its own.
//
// Nothing here fetches or executes: external relationship targets are
// never resolved to bytes, and part names are never trusted as paths.
